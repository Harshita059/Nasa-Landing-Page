        <h2>About NASA</h2>
        <p>NASA's vision is to reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind. Since its formation in 1958, NASA has been on a mission to explore space, perform cutting-edge research, and improve life on Earth.
            The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) insignia has three main official designs, although the one with stylized red curved text (the "worm") was retired from official use from May 22, 1992, until April 3, 2020, when it was reinstated as a secondary logo. The three logos include the NASA insignia (also known as the "meatball"[1]), the NASA logotype (also known as the "worm"), and the NASA seal.[2][3][4]

The NASA seal was approved with an executive order by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959, and slightly modified with an executive order by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.[5][6]
